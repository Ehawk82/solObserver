# solObserver
___
Purpose: To observe voltage and amp collection using a modified solar charge controller.

voltage inputs: solar array, load(pre-regulator)<sup>1</sup>, load(after regulator)

amp input: load(after regulator)

notes:
<sup>1</sup> not a good idea taking input from pre-reg side when there is no input coming from the solar array. To prevent drain at night, i can use one of my handmade relay sensors. it requires 3 AA rechargable batteries that USE energy at night and recharge during the day.  This small subsystem is automated.
